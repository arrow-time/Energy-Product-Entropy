## Energy Product Entropy – Tracing the Stepwise Homogenization of Energy Toward Equilibrium

-An Analytic Quantum Thermodynamics perspective

## Abstract:

This paper presents a new entropy formulation called multiplicative entropy, defined as the product of energy values over all units in a quantized homogeneous invariant network. In contrast to conventional statistical entropy, this approach explicitly captures irreversible energy redistribution pathways, providing an analytic and path-dependent characterization of entropy increase. Applying a logarithmic transformation recovers classical entropy expressions while maintaining temporal directionality and quantum-scale precision. The proposed model allows for accurate simulation of thermodynamic processes, advancing the foundation of Analytic Quantum Thermodynamics as a novel framework for studying entropy-driven dynamics.

## Introduction:
Entropy, as traditionally defined in statistical mechanics, is a measure of disorder based on the logarithm of the number of accessible microstates. While this formulation has been foundational in thermodynamics, it often lacks the resolution and intuitiveness needed to describe the step-by-step evolution of entropy in physical systems. The classical approach focuses primarily on macroscopic end states and provides limited insight into the irreversible dynamics of spontaneous entropy increase.

In contrast, the proposed energy product entropy — or multiplicative entropy — offers a fundamentally new perspective. By defining entropy as the product of energy values across all system units, this approach explicitly tracks the microscopic redistribution of energy at each stage of evolution. It provides a high-resolution, path-dependent description of entropy growth, naturally encoding time’s arrow through local energy flows. Furthermore, this formulation supports the development of analytic quantum thermodynamics, enabling precise simulation and mapping of entropy changes even at the Planck time scale.

This paper demonstrates how multiplicative entropy overcomes the limitations of traditional entropy measures and opens new avenues for understanding thermodynamic processes from a dynamic, computable perspective at the quantum scale.
