Energy Product Entropy VS Statistical Entropy

-An Analytic Quantum Thermodynamics perspective

## Abstract:

This paper introduces a novel entropy formulation — multiplicative entropy — defined as the product of energy values across all units in a quantized homogeneous invariant network. Unlike traditional statistical entropy, this approach explicitly tracks irreversible energy redistribution pathways, offering an analytic and path-dependent description of entropy growth. Logarithmic transformation recovers classical entropy forms, while preserving temporal directionality and quantum-scale resolution. The model enables precise simulation of thermodynamic processes, supporting the development of Analytic Quantum Thermodynamics as a new framework for understanding entropy-driven dynamics.

## Introduction:
Entropy, as traditionally defined in statistical mechanics, is a measure of disorder based on the logarithm of the number of accessible microstates. While this formulation has been foundational in thermodynamics, it often lacks the resolution and intuitiveness needed to describe the step-by-step evolution of entropy in physical systems. The classical approach focuses primarily on macroscopic end states and provides limited insight into the irreversible dynamics of spontaneous entropy increase.

In contrast, the proposed energy product entropy — or multiplicative entropy — offers a fundamentally new perspective. By defining entropy as the product of energy values across all system units, this approach explicitly tracks the microscopic redistribution of energy at each stage of evolution. It provides a high-resolution, path-dependent description of entropy growth, naturally encoding time’s arrow through local energy flows. Furthermore, this formulation supports the development of analytic quantum thermodynamics, enabling precise simulation and mapping of entropy changes even at the Planck time scale.

This paper demonstrates how multiplicative entropy overcomes the limitations of traditional entropy measures and opens new avenues for understanding thermodynamic processes from a dynamic, computable perspective at the quantum scale.
